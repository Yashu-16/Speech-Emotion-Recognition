Speech Emotion Recognition
A comprehensive machine learning project that recognizes human emotions from speech using both classical ML and deep learning approaches.

📋 Project Overview
This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition system capable of detecting emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, and neutrality from audio recordings. It uses multiple approaches including:

Classical Machine Learning (SVM, Random Forest)
Deep Learning (CNN, Feedforward Neural Networks)
Ensemble Methods (Voting, Weighted Fusion)

🎯 Features

✅ Extract 74 acoustic features (MFCCs, pitch, energy, spectral features)
✅ Train multiple ML models and compare performance
✅ Implement ensemble techniques for improved accuracy
✅ Generate comprehensive visualizations (spectrograms, t-SNE, confusion matrices)
✅ Achieve 75-90% accuracy with ensemble methods

📊 Datasets

RAVDESS: 1,440 audio files from 24 actors expressing 8 emotions
